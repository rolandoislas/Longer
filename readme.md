Longer is a program that aids in the creation of very long, boring, pointless GIFs.

This was inspired after reading about [*As Long as Possible*](http://www.aslongaspossible.com/).

What's better than a one thousand year GIF? Having the ability to make even longer GIFs is better!

See it for yourself:
